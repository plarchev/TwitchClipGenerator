# TwitchClipGenerator
Twitch_Clip_Generator.ipynb: Script to automatically pull Twitch vods/chat, clip funny/interesting parts of the stream, add subtitles, and autoupload clips to Youtube/Tiktok.
corpus.ipynb: Helper script to generate entire corpus by taking twitch chat (where applicable) for viral (human-made) clips from the top 100 twitch streamers. This should allow us to better understand what chat messages are most associated with viral clips.
